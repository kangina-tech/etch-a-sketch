# Technologies
<kbd> <br> HTML <br> </kbd>
<kbd> <br> CSS <br> </kbd>
<kbd> <br> JavaScript <br> </kbd>

# Purpose
This is the first big JavaScript project in The Odin Project curriculum. [<kbd> <br> Etch-a-sketch <br> </kbd>](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch )

The goal is to put together all that has been learnt thus far, throwing the learner deep into the programming world and showing half of what is expected of them at the end. The project, while given guidelines, does little in the way of holding the hand of the learner and it is up to them to figure it out in the end.

# Room for Improvement?
Including other technologies would be brilliant. The program could do with the vintage feel of the toy, creating a space where the users can easily create art in a more controlled manner. 
It could also do well with the option of saving projects so that they are not lost. While it will be a stray away from the original intent of the toy, updating that aspect in this while keeping the feel of the other does not impede the enjoyment of it.

# Bug
* Starts are random point.
* Can only draw following one line.

# How To Run It

* Clone repository to your own machine.
* Open the code on preferred code editor.
* Make sure you have all the dependancies you might need for the code to work are installed. You can use <kbd> <br> npm install <br> </kbd> to start and <kbd> <br> npm run start <br> </kbd> to run.
